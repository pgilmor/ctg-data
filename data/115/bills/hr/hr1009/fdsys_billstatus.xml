          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act</b></p> <p>This bill codifies and revises the centralized regulatory review process, currently required under executive order, to require the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget to: (1) review agencies' significant regulatory actions for compliance with procedures for cost-benefit determinations, assessments of alternatives, avoidance of conflicts with other regulations, and consideration of risks and enforcement costs; (2) circulate agency regulatory plans to other agencies to determine whether an agency's actions will conflict with actions taken or planned by other agencies; (3) chair the Regulatory Working Group that assists agencies with regulatory issues; and (4) publish a unified agenda of each agency's regulations that are under development or review.</p> <p>OIRA's review is expanded to independent regulatory agencies. </p> <p>Each year, OIRA must publish the unified agenda by April 15 and October 15. The agenda must explain why any regulation included in the immediately previous agenda is no longer included. </p> <p>The deadline for OIRA's review may be extended for any number of additional 30-day periods upon written request by OIRA or the agency. </p> <p>Within 24 hours after OIRA's review, the agency that submitted the regulation must provide OIRA with a redline of any changes the agency made to the regulatory action during the review period.

Excluded from OIRA's review are: (1) the Government Accountability Office, (2) the Federal Election Commission, (3) the governments of the District of Columbia and of the territories and possessions of the United States, and (4) government-owned contractor-operated facilities.</p> <p>Under the bill, a "significant regulatory action" is any substantive regulatory action normally published in the Federal Register that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final regulation (including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking) that may:</p> <ul> <li>have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; </li> <li>adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; </li> <li>create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; </li> <li>materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients therein; or </li> <li>raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates. </li></ul> <p>The Regulatory Working Group shall consist of OIRA, agencies that have significant domestic regulatory responsibility, and other executive branch officials.</p> <p>Agencies must submit annually to OIRA a regulatory plan with: (1) a summary of the legal basis, need, alternatives, and schedule for each significant regulatory action they expect to issue; (2) the agency employee the public may contact for additional information about each action; (3) a retrospective review of existing regulations that are unjustified, unnecessary, duplicative, inappropriately burdensome, or otherwise recommended for removal; and (4) a description of any other agency program to review existing regulations. </p> <p>OIRA must circulate an agency's regulatory plans to any other agency that may be affected by the plans. The other agencies must notify OIRA if a regulatory action conflicts with their own policies or actions, and OIRA must notify the relevant agencies of any conflicts. </p> <p>To identify regulations that are no longer justified or that affect a particular group, industry, or economy sector, OIRA must: (1) work with interested entities and agencies; (2) meet with state, local, and tribal governments; and (3) convene conferences with businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and the public. </p> <p>By April 15 and October 15 of each year, OIRA must publish the unified agenda of each agency's regulations under development or review. OIRA must: (1) issue guidance for agencies on the manner of submission of regulations for publication in the unified agenda, (2) provide a standard definition for each stage of review to assist the public in understanding the different terms used by agencies, and (3) review agency compliance.</p> <p>The unified agenda must explain why any regulation included in the immediately previous agenda is no longer included. </p> <p>OIRA must conduct a government-wide review of significant regulatory actions to ensure consistency with applicable law and avoid conflict with policy or action taken or planned by another agency.

OIRA shall determine whether submitted regulatory actions are significant and must review each such significant regulatory action.</p> <p>Before issuing a significant regulatory action, an agency must submit to OIRA for review: (1) a description of the need for the action and how the action will meet such need; (2) an assessment of the costs and benefits; and (3) an explanation of the manner in which the significant regulatory action is consistent with a statutory mandate and avoids undue interference with state, local, and tribal government functions. For economically significant regulatory actions, the agency must also submit any assessments developed during the decision-making process that quantify the costs and benefits of the regulatory action versus feasible alternatives and explain why the planned regulatory action is preferable to potential alternatives. </p> <p>OIRA's deadline to complete a review after an agency's submission of a regulation is: (1) 10 days for a notice of inquiry, advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or other preliminary regulatory action prior to a notice of proposed rulemaking; (2) 90 days for any other significant regulatory action that is not preliminary; or (3) 45 days if OIRA has previously reviewed a regulatory action that was not preliminary and there has been no material change in the facts and circumstances.</p> <p>OIRA's review period may be extended for any number of additional 30-day periods upon written request by OIRA or the agency. An extension shall be granted unless the nonrequesting party denies the request in writing within five days after receipt.</p> <p>If OIRA is unable to complete a review before the deadline, it may return the draft of the regulatory action to the agency with an explanation of why the review could not be completed and what additional information, resources, or time OIRA would need to complete the review. An agency may withdraw the regulatory action from OIRA review at any time prior to its completion.</p> <p>OIRA's review of significant regulatory actions must determine the extent to which the agency:</p> <ul> <li>identified and assessed the significance of the problem the regulation is designed to address; </li> <li>examined whether to modify any existing regulations or laws that create or contribute to the problem; </li> <li>assessed alternatives to direct regulation, including economic incentives to encourage desired behaviors; </li> <li>considered risks, costs and benefits, enforcement and compliance, incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, flexibility, distributive impacts, and equity; </li> <li>used the best reasonably obtainable information; </li> <li>identified performance objectives rather than behavior or manner of compliance; </li> <li>sought comments from, assessed effects on, and harmonized regulations with the functions of state, local, and tribal governments; </li> <li>avoided conflicts with or duplication of other existing regulations; </li> <li>tailored the regulatory action to impose the least burden on society; </li> <li>drafted the regulatory action to be simple and easy to understand; and </li> <li>complied with requirements under executive orders, statutes, and applicable guidance. </li></ul> <p>OIRA must allow other agencies to review the draft regulatory action for at least 10 business days, solicit comments from other agencies, and facilitate conversations between agencies. </p> <p>OIRA must provide an agency with the results of every standard, executive order, guidance document, and law reviewed. </p> <p>Within 24 hours after the conclusion of the OIRA review, the submitting agency shall provide OIRA with a redline of any changes the agency made to the regulatory action during the review period.
