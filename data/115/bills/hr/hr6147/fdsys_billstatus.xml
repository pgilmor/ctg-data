        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Quigley motion to recommit with instructions pending a reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to decrease funds for the Fund for America's Kids and Grandkids account by $380 million and increase funds for the Election Assistance Commission account by a similar amount. Subsequently, the reservation was removed.</text>
