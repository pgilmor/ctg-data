          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act</b></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to:</p> <ul> <li>coordinate the development and implementation of federal government activities to improve the nation's ability to prepare, avoid, mitigate, respond to, and recover from potentially devastating impacts of space weather events; and </li> <li>coordinate the activities of the Space Weather Interagency Working Group, which shall be established by the National Science and Technology Council to continue coordination of executive branch efforts to understand, prepare, coordinate, and plan for space weather. </li> </ul> <p>In order to understand and respond to the adverse effects of space weather, the working group shall leverage capabilities across participating federal agencies. </p> <p>It is the sense of Congress that the interagency collaboration between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on terrestrial weather observations provides:</p> <ul> <li>an effective mechanism for improving weather and climate data collection while avoiding unnecessary duplication of capabilities across federal agencies, and </li> <li>an agency collaboration model that could benefit space weather observations. </li> </ul> <p>NASA and NOAA shall enter into at least one interagency agreement that provides for cooperation and collaboration in the development of space weather spacecraft, instruments, and technologies.</p> <p>It is U.S. policy to establish and sustain a baseline capability for space weather observations.</p> <p>The OSTP, in coordination with NOAA, NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Defense (DOD), shall develop an integrated strategy for solar and solar wind observations beyond the lifetime of current assets that considers the provision of:</p> <ul> <li>solar wind measurements and other measurements essential to space weather forecasting, and</li> <li>solar and space weather measurements important for scientific purposes. </li> </ul> <p>In developing such strategy, the OSTP shall consider small satellite options, hosted payloads, commercial options, international options, and prize authority. </p> <p>In order to sustain current space-based observational capabilities, NASA shall:</p> <ul> <li>in cooperation with the European Space Agency, maintain operations of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO) for as long as it continues to deliver quality observations, and </li> <li>prioritize the reception of LASCO data. </li> </ul> <p>NOAA shall secure reliable secondary capability for near real-time coronal mass ejection imagery. </p> <p>NOAA, in coordination with DOD and NASA, shall develop options to build and deploy one or more instruments for near real-time coronal mass ejection imagery.</p> <p>In developing such options, NOAA shall consider commercial solutions, prize authority, academic and international partnerships, microsatellites, ground-based instruments, and opportunities to deploy the instrument or instruments as a secondary payload on an upcoming planned launch. </p> <p>In securing reliable secondary capability for near real-time coronal mass ejection imagery, NOAA shall make it a priority to achieve a cost-effective solution.</p> <p>NOAA shall develop an operational contingency plan to provide continuous space weather forecasting in the event of a SOHO/LASCO failure.</p> <p>Within 120 days of the enactment of this bill, NOAA shall brief Congress on the options for building and deploying the instrument or instruments and the operational contingency plan. </p> <p>NOAA, in coordination with DOD, shall develop requirements and a plan for follow-on space-based observations for operational purposes. </p> <p>The OSTP shall report to Congress on the integrated strategy, including the plans for follow-on space-based observations. </p> <p>The NSF the Air Force, and where practicable in support of the Air Force, the Navy shall each:</p> <ul> <li>maintain and improve, as necessary and advisable, ground-based observations of the sun; and </li> <li>provide space weather data by means of ground-based facilities, including radars, lidars, magnetometers, radio receivers, aurora and airglow imagers, spectrometers, interferometers, and solar observatories. </li> </ul> <p>The NSF shall: </p> <ul> <li>provide key data streams from such platforms for research and to support space weather model development,</li> <li>develop experimental models for scientific purposes, and</li> <li>support the transition of such models to operations where appropriate. </li> </ul> <p>NOAA, the Air Force, and where practicable in support of the Air Force, the Navy, in conjunction with other relevant federal agencies, shall conduct a survey to identify and prioritize the needs of space weather forecast users, including space weather data and space weather forecast data needed to improve services and inform research priorities and technology needs. </p> <p>NOAA, the Air Force, and where practicable in support of the Air Force, the Navy, shall: <ul> <li>make the survey's results publicly available; and</li> <li>notify Congress of making those results available to the public. </li> </ul> <p> The NSF, NASA, and DOD shall continue to carry out basic research activities on heliophysics, geospace science, and space weather and support competitive, merit-based, peer-reviewed proposals for research, modeling, and monitoring of space weather and its impacts, including science goals outlined in Solar and Space Physics Decadal surveys conducted by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). </p> <p> The NSF, NOAA, and NASA shall pursue multidisciplinary research in subjects that further our understanding of solar physics, space physics, and space weather. </p> <p>It is the sense of Congress that NASA and the NSF should support competitively awarded Heliophysics Science Centers. </p> <p>NASA shall seek to implement missions meeting science objectives identified in NAS Solar and Space Physics Decadal surveys. </p> <p>NASA, the NSF, NOAA, and the Air Force, and where practicable in support of the Air Force, the Navy shall:</p> <ul> <li>develop a mechanism to transition NASA, NSF, Air Force, and Navy research findings, models, and capabilities to NOAA and DOD space weather operational forecasting centers;
