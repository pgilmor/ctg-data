          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018</b></p> <p> TITLE I--WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT</p> <p><i>Water Resources Development Act of 2018</i></p> <p> Subtitle A--General Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 1102) The bill provides for a study on: (1) the ability of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out its statutory missions and responsibilities, and (2) improving the Corps of Engineers' project delivery processes. </p> <p>(Sec. 1103) The Corps of Engineers must contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study the economic principles and analytical methodologies used when formulating, evaluating, and budgeting for water resources development projects. The study must make recommendations on potential changes to such principles and methodologies to improve transparency, return on federal investment, cost savings, and prioritization. </p> <p>(Sec. 1104) The Corps of Engineers must develop, support, and implement education and awareness efforts for nonfederal interests with respect to the annual Report to Congress on Future Water Resources Development required under the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014.</p> <p>(Sec. 1105) Prior to developing and issuing implementation guidance for certain water resources development laws, the Corps of Engineers must notify nonfederal stakeholders and allow them to provide input.

In establishing the expedited process, FERC must convene an interagency task force with appropriate federal and state agencies and Indian tribes to coordinate the regulatory process associated with the authorizations required to construct and operate a qualifying facility. FERC must assess the safety of existing nonfederal dams and other nonfederal structures related to the qualifying facility before issuing a license.</p> <p>FERC must coordinate with the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture to jointly develop a list of existing nonpowered federal dams that have the greatest potential for nonfederal hydropower development.</p> <p>(Sec. 3004) FERC may establish an expedited licensing process for issuing and amending licenses for closed-loop pumped storage projects in which the upper and lower reservoirs do not impound or directly withdraw water from navigable waters, or that are not continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature.</p> <p> In addition, FERC must: (1) assess the safety of existing dams and other structures related to the project before issuing a license for a closed-loop storage project, and (2) hold a workshop to explore potential opportunities for development of storage projects at abandoned mine sites. </p> <p>(Sec. 3005) The bill outlines considerations that FERC must make when determining the relicensing terms for hydropower licensees. </p> <p>(Sec. 3006) The bill sets forth procedures for the case of FERC not taking action after notice by a public utility of a rate change. </p> <p>(Sec. 3007) The bill authorizes FERC, upon request, to extend by six years the time period during which construction must commence on the Red River Lock and Dam No. 3, 4, and 5 Hydroelectric Projects located on the Red River in Louisiana. The licensee is not required to pay an annual charge for administrative expenses until construction commences. FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired.</p> <p> (Sec. 3008) FERC, upon request, must issue a stay of the statutory deadline by which construction must commence on the Mahoney Lake Hydroelectric Project located in Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska. </p> <p>If certain conditions are met, FERC may extend for up to six years the statutory deadline by which construction must commence on the project. </p> <p>(Sec. 3009) The Department of Energy must draw down and sell 5,000,000 barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2028. </p> <p>TITLE IV--OTHER MATTERS </p> <p>Subtitle A--Clean Water </p> <p>(Sec. 4101) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must establish a stormwater infrastructure funding task force composed of representatives from governmental and private entities.

and (2) monitor progress toward meeting the goals, actions, and schedules of the plan.</p> <p>The limit on the federal share for certain grants for projects and studies to help implement the plan is revised by increasing the limit for grants other than citizen involvement and education grants. </p> <p>A federal agency that owns or occupies real property, or carries out activities, within the sound watershed must ensure that the property and activities are consistent with the plan to the maximum extent practicable.</p> <p> (Sec. 4105) The bill reauthorizes the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program through FY2021. </p> <p>(Sec. 4106) The bill reauthorizes through FY2020 and revises the sewer overflow control grant program, including by allowing the EPA to provide grants for measures to reuse stormwater. </p> <p>(Sec. 4107) States may use their SRFs to provide assistance to households with income below a certain threshold for decentralized wastewater systems or cost-effective connections of the households to publicly owned treatment works.</p> <p>Subtitle B--WIFIA Reauthorization and Innovative Financing for State Loan Funds </p> <p>(Sec. 4201) WRRDA 2014 is amended to reauthorize through FY2021 and revise the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, including by providing additional sources of funding for state infrastructure financing authorities.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Miscellaneous </p> <p>(Sec. 4302) The Bureau of Reclamation must develop a flood prevention action plan for each state within the Snake River Basin.</p> <p> (Sec. 4303) The GAO must audit and report on certain maintenance repayment contracts between the United States and the Bostwick Division for repairs to the Tainter gates and other features at the Harlan County Dam in Nebraska.</p> <p>(Sec. 4304) The EPA must establish a competitive grant program to: (1) assist the development of innovative activities relating to workforce development in the water utility sector, and (2) expand public awareness about water utilities and connect individuals to careers in the water utility sector. </p> <p>(Sec. 4305) The EPA must assign at least one employee in each of its regional offices to serve as a liaison to minority, tribal, and low-income communities.</p> <p>(Sec. 4306) The bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide statutory authority for the WaterSense Program of the EPA, which allows water-efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services to bear a &quot;WaterSense&quot; label.</p>   <p> (Sec. 4307) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must use the most expeditious procedure practicable to process and administer certain permits that allow the taking of certain wild animals, such as bald eagles. </p> <p>(Sec. 4308) The Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to authorize Interior to align water supplies and demand for irrigation water users associated with the Klamath Project, which is a Reclamation project in California and Oregon.</p> <p> (Sec. 4309) The federal cost share for the operation and maintenance of certain dikes owned by Reclamation must be 100%.</p> <p> (Sec. 4310) The bill authorizes Interior, in cooperation with Wyoming, to amend the Definite Plan Report for the Seedskadee Project to enable the use of all active storage capacity of Fontenelle Dam and Reservoir.</p> <p> (Sec. 4311) The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act is amended to: (1) revise the requirements governing the Blackfeet settlement trust fund, (2) extend through FY2028 appropriations for the Indian Irrigation Fund as well as a program of the Corps of Engineers that assists Indian tribes with certain irrigation projects, and (3) extend through FY2030 appropriations for the High-Hazard Indian Dam Safety Deferred Maintenance Fund.</p> <p>(Sec. 4315) The bill designates the U.S. courthouse at 300 South Fourth Street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as the &quot;Diana E.
